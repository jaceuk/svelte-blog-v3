Blogs were all the rage over a decade ago so I realise I'm rather late to the party but this isn't about you, it's about me. Let me explain.

## I forget more than I remember

The great Homer J Simpson once said

> Every time I learn something new it pushes some old stuff out

Never was that more true than today. The sheer number of different topics you need to cover as a front end developer is mind boggling so having this blog will hopefully give me somewhere to keep note of anything that tickles my fancy.

Just the act of writing about a topic should help me remember more and when I inevitably forget I'll know where to go to refresh my memory.

## Web development is complicated

I started my development career is simpler times where all you had to know where:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript and/or jQuery

Fast forward to today and your typical front end tech stack might be:

- Semantic HTML
- Accessibility
- Search Engine Optimisation
- CSS
- SASS
- A CSS framework such as Bootstrap or Tailwind
- JavaScript
- A Javascript framework or library such as React, Vue or Angular (Let's face it, it's React!)
- Familiarity with a boat load of third party NPM packages each with their own API
- Styled components or CSS modules
- Git
- NodeJS (It's Javascript so has to be a front end task right?)
- Jest or similar testing framework
- and the list goes on ...

The comparison between then and now is pretty scary and staying up to date is a real problem. Not only that but but there's always new technologies to learn and they never get less complex.

I figure I can help by writing blog posts to keep myself up to date and to help me learn. They say the best way to learn is to teach so I'm going to teach myself and if it's ever of use to anyone else then that's an added bonus.

So let's see how I get on and let's hope that this doesn't just become yet another abandoned blog full of the best intentions.
