Does anyone else sometimes stop and look at their code and, whilst understanding what's going on, would struggle to explain what a specific term means?

Ok, so it's just me then. Regardless here's a glossary of terms to help remind me of exactly what they mean.

**Note:** I've included terms that apply to a wide range of skill levels as they may be of help to anyone still learning.

## Acronyms

### HTML

HyperText Markup Language

### CSS

Cascading Style Sheet

### Sass

Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets

### Less

Leaner Style Sheets

### PHP

## React

### useEffect

The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components. Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.

### useLayoutEffect

The useLayoutEffect hook fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. Use this to read layout from the DOM and synchronously re-render.

### useMemo

The useMemo hook that allows you to memoize expensive functions so that you can avoid calling them on every render. You simply pass in a function and an array of inputs and useMemo will only recompute the memoized value when one of the inputs has changed.

### useReducer

The useReducer hook returns an array that holds the current state value and a dispatch function to which you can pass an action and later invoke it.

## Miscellaneous

### Reducer

A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the next state i.e. (state, action) => newState.
