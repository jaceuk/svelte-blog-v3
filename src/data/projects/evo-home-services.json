    "This project involved designing and building two separate dynamically generated websites along with a single page portal site.",
    "The goal of this project was to increase lead generation by aggressively targeting local search results.",
    "The sites mix content templates with location information and reviews to dynamically create a large number of unique and relevant pages.",
    "The site gets it's data from a REST API built using the Slim micro framework for PHP with a bespoke secure admin area which allows the client to add their Checkatrade reviews to the site.",
    "They rank extremely well for a large number of search terms such as Boiler Servicing Handcross, Central Heating Southwater, and Power Flushing Redhill.",
    "Almost immediately there was an uptick in enquiries from the websites and a few months later the monthly website enquiries had increased by approximately 9,000 percent (no, that's not a typo!). These are all fully qualified enquiries, no spam!",
    "I was responsible for all aspects of this project."
